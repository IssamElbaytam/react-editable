## React Editable 1.0.2

Build flexible WYSIWYG editors with ease

## WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU BUILD AN EDITOR?!

I felt the ones I found currently built in React all relied on another library and weren't as flexiblie as I'd like. And I wanted to show the power of the DOM and React working together to create a lightweight, flexible, and full-rich text editor :)
